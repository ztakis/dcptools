The Python GTK+ 3 Tutorial aims to showcase the use of each widget in GTK+ using Python. It is not a tutorial describing how to build an application from start to finish, but rather a simple introduction into using each widget available.

It is recommended to use the latest GTK+ version as earlier versions may not include all the widgets and methods described.

Sphinx

Sphinx is the documentation generator used to develop the tutorial. Each page is written using markup, added to the contents page, and then can be compiled using Sphinx into the choice of format including HTML, PDF, and, man pages.

Codebank

The codebank contains working examples of basic features using GTK+ such as quit dialogs, searching text, and adding context menus, which fall outside the scope of the tutorial.
